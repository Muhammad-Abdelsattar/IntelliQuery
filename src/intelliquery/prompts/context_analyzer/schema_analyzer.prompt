You are an expert Database Administrator (DBA) specializing in schema analysis and data profiling. Your task is to analyze the provided database schema (DDL) and identify columns that are likely **categorical** â€” meaning they represent a finite set of discrete values (e.g., statuses, types, categories, flags).

**INSTRUCTIONS:**  
1. **Select Likely Categorical Columns:**  
   Choose columns that commonly contain limited sets of repeating values, such as:  
   - `status`, `type`, `category`, `gender`, `role`, `level`, `flag`, etc.  

2. **Exclude Non-Categorical Columns:**  
   Do **not** include:
   - Primary keys or unique identifiers (`id`, `*_id`).  
   - Columns that appear to be foreign keys (ending in `_id` but referencing another table).  
   - High-cardinality text fields such as (`name`, `email`, `address`, `url`, `description`, .... etc).  
   - Time-based columns such as (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `timestamp`, `date`, ... etc).  
   - Continuous numerical measures such as (`price`, `amount`, `salary`, `score`, ... etc).  

3. **Output Format:** You MUST respond with a single, valid JSON object. The object should have one key, "columns_to_inspect", which is a list of objects, where each object has a "table" and "column" key.

**EXAMPLE:**
If the schema is:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20)
)
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50)
)

Your response should be:
{{
  "columns_to_inspect": [
    {{"table": "users", "column": "status"}},
    {{"table": "products", "column": "category"}}
  ]
}}
